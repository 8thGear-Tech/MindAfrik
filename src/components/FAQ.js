                What is therapy and how does it work?
              </Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                Therapy is a process of talking with a trained mental health
                professional to address emotional or psychological difficulties.
                It works by providing a safe and supportive space for
                individuals to explore their thoughts, feelings, and
                experiences. The goal is to help individuals gain insight, learn
                coping skills, and improve their overall well-being. At
                Mindafrik, We assist in the ways and manners that people view
                their mental health and help them tackle lifeâ€™s challenges by
                providing accessible, confidential and qualitative care.
